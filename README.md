# learning_arb

This is my initial attempt at learning about dex arbitrage. I was working on this in ~july-august 2021. 
I read through flashbots simple arbitrage and was inspired to use dex arbitrage as a framework for me to learn how to program.
While working on this I became interested in learning a faster/more "advanced" programming language and started looking at go and rust.
I became discouraged and stopped working on this project directly due to confusion while reading through UniswapV3Pool.sol. At the time I
was confused about all the bitwise operations and specifically it was the functions getSqrtRatioAtTick and getTickAtSqrtRatio in
TickMath.sol that I could not figure out.
